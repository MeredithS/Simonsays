each color gets a number 1,2,3,4

upon clicking the button the computer will randomly pick a sequence of colors beginning with one number.  The sequence has to be saved..in an array? the numbers correspond to a color that must show animation in the web browser to signify they have been chosen. The color must "flash" for a set of miliseconds before moving on to the next one. maybe a function can be written for each? must do a delay of some sort here between items in array.  

( .forEeach the new array with a function that asks if the color is an id for anything if yes make it animate?)

then the player chooses a sequence..saved as well into an array? when the player finishes their choices the sequence will play back what the player has chosen and stop at the wrong one(maybe play a sound?)  as soon as the sequence shows to be wrong the game must stop-ie take away event listeners and a message can display on the side that the player has lost and they can play again.

or if sequence is correct message displays round has been won and moves onto the next and round counter increase by one.

maybe put a move counter so player knows how many moves left they have.
