User Stories:

The board should begin with four different pictures or colors arranged in a clear manner; it could be in a straight line or most typically in a circle. The board will have a button that invites the player to begin playing.  Once the player clicks on the button or hits enter the game will begin and continue in rounds until the player loses.

The first round will begin with the computer highlighting, for a few miliseconds, one of the colors or images.  The player must choose the same color or image the that computer highlights.  If the player chooses the correct color or image then the player wins the round and moves on to the next one.

The next round has the computer increase the number of colors or images highlighted by one.  The player must click on the images or colors in the same order the computer highlighted them.  The rounds conitnue correspondingly until the player mistakes the order of the highlighed colors or images.  If the player makes a mistake the player is alerted that they have lost and will have have the option of playing again by pressing the "let's play button".
